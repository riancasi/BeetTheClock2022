# BeetTheClock2022
BeetTheClock is web app that allows grocery stores and fast food chains to participate in giving out or selling their products at discounted prices that they would otherwise throw away at the end of the day. Individuals who cannot afford regular priced items will have the ability to pick up food from these locations and be given times to get these food and groceries for no cost.
